	Twenty Twenty-Three is designed to take advantage of the new design tools introduced in WordPress 6.1. With a clean, blank base as a starting point, 
this default theme includes ten diverse style variations created by members of the WordPress community.
	
	Whether you want to build a complex or incredibly simple website, 
you can do it quickly and intuitively through the bundled styles or dive into creation and full customization yourself.
